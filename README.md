## About

This started out as part of [StoryBot](https://discord.com/application-directory/623698680574115841), a discord bot written by me, John Wuller. I want to contribute back to the open source community, but I don't want someone to just yoink my code and just rip off all my work. This is my compromise: while StoryBot itself is not open source, it's framework is. Feel free to take this code and create your own Discord bots!

If you create a discord bot using this framework, let me know! Also, feel free to contribute back if you have any ways this could be improved.
